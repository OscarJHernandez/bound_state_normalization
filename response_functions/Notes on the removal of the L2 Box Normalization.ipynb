    "This Notebook walks us through some examples of how the Normalization is removed in order to produce the correctly normalized Response function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our desired integrals are of the form, $I(f)$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$I(f) = \\int \\limits_{\\omega_0}^{\\infty} d\\omega \\ f(\\omega) R_{\\hat{O}}(\\omega) = \\sum\\limits_{k \\neq 0} f(\\omega_k) |\\langle f_k |\\hat{O}|0 \\rangle|^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $R_{\\hat{O}}(\\omega)$, is the Response function that we would like to extract. Now, in a finite $L2$ basis such as the harmonic oscillator the final states are normalized according the IR limits of the basis. We will denote the $L2$ normalized final states as $| \\ f_k \\rangle$ and $| \\ \\tilde{f}_k \\rangle$ as the states with the correct asymptotic normalization. The relation between these two states will be given as\n",

    "$| \\ f_k \\rangle = \\sqrt{w_k} | \\ \\tilde{f}_k \\rangle$  \n",

    "Since  $\\langle \\ f_k | \\ f_k \\rangle = 1$, then  we have that  \n",

    "In order to retrieve the Response function $R(\\omega)$ at the points $\\omega_k$ we need to remove the quadrature weight factor $w_k$. In general, this factor can be computed according to the expression\n",

    "To use the above method, we perform the following steps (Works for any quadrature rule):\n",

    "Note: $k$ is just the index that labels the point (k=1,2,..)  \n",
    "2. Spline the points $\\lbrace k,x_k \\rbrace$, so that we have a continuous function $x(\\eta)$, where $x(k)=x_k$.\n",
    "3. Then compute the weight factors $\\ w_k = \\lim\\limits_{\\eta \\rightarrow k}\\frac{dx}{d\\eta}(\\eta)$\n",
    "4. Then calculate the corrected function  $ \\ \\tilde{f}(x_k) = \\frac{f(x_k)}{w_k}$\n",
